    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <P>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.
        Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeysexcept the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic
        Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago.
        New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago.
        Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.
        Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35â€“32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.
        The simian's sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.</P>
