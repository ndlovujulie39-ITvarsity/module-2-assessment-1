    <h3>MOS-PIZZAE</h3>
    <P>The word mos-pizza"pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the central Italian town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD.
         the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze ("twelve pizzas"),
          every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday
          The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo meaning "mouthful" (related to the English words "bit" and "bite"),
           which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading Lombards.[4][17] The shift b>p could be explained by the High German consonant shift, 
           and it has been noted in this connection that in German the word Imbiss means "snack".
           A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889,
           when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherit.
           Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag â€” red (tomato), </P>
